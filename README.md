**Easily readable font**

The font is always easily readable, since it is a fixed size. Different application / websites uses different layout and sizes, but with Kibodeu you text will always be the same size. No matter what size the input field is, you can easily read your text before you input it.

**Beginner friendly**

No need for stickers, memorizing keyboard layouts or cheat sheets. As a beginner having to learn keyboard layouts is a burden on top of learning the korean language. When learning hangeul you should already be familiar with romanization. Just use romanization and the app will automatically convert it to korean.

**Small screenspace**

Kibodeu only take up 1 line of text, where Windows On Screen Keybaord takes up 6 times the space.

**No cost**

With Kibodeu you get all features for free with no ads. Open Source aswell.

## Kibodeu vs Real korean keyboard / stickers / covers

- No cost
- Compatibility

**No cost**

No need to pay for additional hardware, stickers or covers.

**Compatibility**

Im not sure wich keyboard layout the korean keyboard is based off, but if you have a keyboard where special characters are different from the korean keyboard layout you will have a hard time using your native input. So you end up putting stickers on the korean keyboard and you probably bought the keyboard to avoid stickers in the first place. The only other solution is to buy a cover or stickers for your native keyboard that only covers the hangeul keys, unless some of those differ. With Kibodeu you can write hangeul without switching your keyboard layout and avoid any issues.
