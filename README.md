## Kibodeu vs Windows On Screen Keyboard

- Easily readable font
- Beginner friendly
- Small screenspace


**Easily readable font**

The font is always easily readable, since it is a fixed size. Different application / websites uses different layout and sizes, but with Kibodeu you text will always be the same size. No matter what size the input field is, you can easily read your text before you input it.

**Beginner friendly**

No need for stickers, memorizing keyboard layout or cheat sheets. As a beginner having to learn keyboard, is a burden on top of learning the korean language. When learning hanguel you should already be familair with romanization.

**Small screenspace**

This only take up 1 line of text, where Windows OSK take up 6 times the space.

## Kibodeu vs Real korean keyboard

**No cost**

No need to pay for additional hardware or software.

**Compatibility**

Im not sure wich keyboard layout the korean keyboard is based off, but if you have a keyboard where special characters are in a difference place than the korean keyboard you will have a hard time using your native language.
